# Crazy-Cars-Game

It ItÂ´s a game created in Cocos2d-x
It consists of 3 levels

In all 3 levels you have to dodge other cars by moving the player to the left or right.

In level 1 there is a road with three lanes and you have to collect 3 stars to win, if you collide with 3 cars the game ends and makes us start from the first level 
regardless of which level we are at.

On the second level there is a highway with 2 lanes and two directions of traffic.
Unlike the first level, in this one you can also speed up.

In the third level it is a road with 3 cars, this time all the cars come in the opposite direction to the player.

The scoring system consists of 10,000 points at the start of the game, with the passage of time points are removed 
and when hitting other cars, 500 points are subtracted.
